# LinuxScripts
Some linux scripts I wrote for personal use 

**airplane-mode.sh**

Toggles Wifi and sends a notification saying that Airplane mode is on/off. Is meant to be used with a keyboard shortcut.

**battest.sh**

Checks to see if battery is less than 20 or greater than 80. If so, it sends a notification indicating that it needs more charge or that it is overcharged. Is meant to be used with cron or some timer. 

**touchscreen.py**

Toggles an ELAN Touchscreen enabled state. Is meant to be used with a keyboard shortcut.
